-- Read this article. Take a moment and reflect on the implications of how and week SQL
-- executes in the order that it does. Then look at the following examples, and
-- write out in order /explain what order the code runs. 
-- BONUS: after you've going through once and done either (write out/explain)
-- try to go back and do the other.

-- EXAMPLE:
SELECT film_id, title, actor_id
FROM film JOIN film_actor
WHERE language_id = 1 AND
	  rating = 'G'
ORDER BY film_id; ANSWER #1

select film_id, title,language_id ,rating
from film
group by film_id
having language_id = 1 and rating = 'R'
order bY film_id;

-- ANSWER:
1 - film JOIN film_actor
2 - FROM #1
3 - WHERE language_id = 1 AND rating = 'G'
4 - SELECT *
5 ORDER BY film_id;

-- Alternative answer:
-- We first take the film table and join it to the film_actor table as the base 
-- table for the query. That is then filtered by the WHERE clause to only rows 
-- that have both language_id #1 AND rated 'G'. From that, film_id, title, and 
-- actor_id are selected (/returned), and the results are ordered by film_id.
